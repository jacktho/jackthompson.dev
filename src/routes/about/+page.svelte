				My love for technology dates back to 1994, and I have been fascinated with the internet and
				its potential since my early years. My journey as a web developer began in 1999 when I
				created a website for sharing music downloads. Over the years, I have honed my skills in
				various technologies but currently prefer a stack that includes Svelte, SvelteKit, and
				Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I've worked with various types of traditional backends but
				prefer to use a BaaS like Supabase and edge or serverless functions when possible.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-8">
				My diverse professional experiences have included a role as a QA test engineer working on
				early mobile applications, running my own web development and IT support business, and
				co-founding two startups in the insurance and financial advisory industries. These
				experiences have allowed me to develop a broad range of skills and expertise, including app
				development, project management, and team leadership.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-8">
				In our current startup, I have built several applications that streamline processes for our
				clients in the financial advisory sector. My expertise in creating user-friendly
				applications and finding innovative solutions to complex problems has been a driving force
				behind our company's success.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-8">
				While my professional journey has taken various paths, my passion for web development has
				remained constant. I am confident in my ability to create competitive web applications and
				am eager to take on new challenges.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-8">
				I'm also a technology nerd and love things like Linux, Docker, Neovim, and prefer to do most
				tasks on the command line when possible. I'm into things like DIY smart home automation.
